                <p>On March 11, 2015, Alibaba was said to be investing in Snapchat with a $15 billion valuation. In February 2015, the rumours for Snapchatâ€™s valuation rested at $19 billion. This is taking into account that until January this year, Snapchat hadn't built a revenue stream. A portal that was created by millennials, for the millennials, the mobile based social network became the fastest growing mobile app of 2014, according to a study by the Global Web Index. Shortly after that study came out, Snapchat Discover was announced, the first step by the company towards revenue. Amidst sky-high valuations, as the company lays down the first step in structuring a business model, here is the making of Snapchat in snaps.</p>
